## Current Layout System

### Container System

- **Container Utility:** Auto margins with 1rem horizontal padding
- **Max Widths:** Controlled by Tailwind breakpoints (1024px, 1280px, 1536px)
- **Container Alignment:** Left/right alignment utilities for asymmetric layouts

### Current Spacing Patterns

#### Section Spacing

- **Hero Sections:** `py-10` to `py-44` (40px to 176px vertical padding)
- **Content Sections:** `py-20` to `py-28.5` (80px to 114px vertical padding)
- **Component Spacing:** `gap-4` to `gap-20` (16px to 80px)

#### Component Internal Spacing

- **Cards:** `p-6` (24px padding)
- **Forms:** `gap-6` to `gap-8` (24px to 32px)
- **Grids:** `gap-4` to `gap-16` (16px to 64px)
